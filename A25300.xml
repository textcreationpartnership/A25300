            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BILLS or Notes of Credit, ſecur'd on a valuable and certain Fund, are of great Advantage to Commerce &amp; Trade, Payments being thereby made eaſie, quick, &amp; certain: but if ſuch Notes or Bills of Credit are not ſo ſtrictly <hi>Limited,</hi> as they cannot exceed the Values of their Funds, they may prove a Damage to Traffick, and a Loſs to the Trader; for, Bills given out upon an <hi>Vnlimited</hi> Credit, muſt chiefly have for their Security the Profit of thoſe Undertakings wherein the Moneys are employ'd for which thoſe Bills of Credit were given, and therefore differ little from the Truſt or Credit that is given to private Traders, which is good or bad, as they are fortunate or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, and ſo grow Rich or Poor by their Trades.</p>
            <p>Therefore that the <hi>Lands</hi> of <hi>England</hi> may be made a <hi>Solid, Certain</hi> &amp; <hi>Well-Limited</hi> Fund of Credit: As uſeful to the Owners as ſo much Ready Money, And of greater value: Is the deſign of the <hi>Land Bank,</hi> as will appear by the manner of the Settlement and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of it.</p>
            <div type="settlement">
               <head>The Manner of the Settlement.</head>
               <p n="1">1. The Governors of the <hi>Land-Bank</hi> will Lend Money on Land or Houſes, at 3 <abbr>

                     <abbr>s.</abbr> per Cent. per Ann.</hi> to all Perſons that ſhall Convey their Eſtates according to the Settlement, which is thus: Their Eſtates are to be convey'd in Truſt for the payment of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal and Intereſt to the Governors of the <hi>Land-Bank;</hi> And upon further Truſt, That the ſaid Governors may have Power to charge the ſaid Lands with Notes or Bills of Credit for the ſaid Moneys ſo borrow'd, and Intereſt for the ſame.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> charged on the Land &amp; given out by the Governors for the taking in of Money, ſhall be paid on demand, with Intereſt after the rate of 2 <hi>
                     <abbr>l.</abbr> per Cent. per Ann.</hi> For which purpoſe <hi>One Hundred Thouſand Pounds is Subſcribing,</hi> That there may be a ſufficient Caſh lye ready to anſwer ſuch <hi>Bills.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That the Funds of Credit may be certain, and well limited, The Governors are not to lend or charge any <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> for more than Three fourths of the Value of the Land or Houſes. And every <hi>Bill</hi> will have Reference, by a <hi>Letter</hi> and <hi>Figure,</hi> to the <hi>Book</hi> and <hi>Place</hi> where the Land is Regiſter'd on which that <hi>Bill</hi> is charg'd.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That no Loſs may for ever happen to any of their <hi>Bills of Credit,</hi> thro' Deficiency of Title, or Want of Value; The Governors are immediately to lay out Ten thouſand Pounds, part of the One hundred thouſand Pounds ſubſcrib'd, as a Collateral Security to Enſure the Value of their <hi>Bills;</hi> And alſo every Year to lay out Ten Shillings of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the 3 <abbr>

               <p n="5">5. <hi>The Borrowers of Money</hi> may at any time, without giving Notice, pay in the Money borrow'd, or any part of it, and their Lands will be accordingly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd: Or they may continue it (paying the Intereſt) till three years after the firſt notice to be given for the payment of the Principal in, by a <hi>Monthly Account.</hi> The Intereſt of 3 <abbr>

                  </abbr> is to be paid Quarterly; but in caſe it be not paid within One month after the Six months is due, then they muſt pay after the rate of 5 <hi>per Cent.</hi> for the Six months.</p>
               <p n="6">6. There will be a <hi>Monthly Account</hi> from the <hi>Land-Bank</hi> printed and publiſh'd the firſt <hi>Monday</hi> in every Month, which is the Notice, by the Settlement, for all Matters relating to the <hi>Bank;</hi> And it will be alſo uſed for the publiſhing of the Sale of Land and Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which will be beneficial for the Buyer and Seller.

And, that the Sale of Land or Houſes may be as quickly diſpatch'd as the Sale of Goods; If the Purchaſer will pay down One-fourth part of the Value, the Governors of the <hi>Bank</hi> will lend him the other Three fourths, and continue the ſame at Intereſt.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Governors of the <hi>Bank</hi> are to be choſen yearly by the Majority of Votes: Every Subſcriber for 100 <abbr>l.</abbr> to have One Vote, and none more than Ten Votes.

               <p>
                  <hi>The Advantages to the Borrowers: Are,</hi> That they may have Money at 3 <abbr>

                  </abbr> 10 <hi>
                     <abbr>s.</abbr> per Cent.</hi> Three fourths of the Value of their Lands: And may pay back the Money at any time; Either the whole or part; which laſt Advantage is ſo great, that for want of it, the Borrowers often ſuffer very great Loſſes; for when the <hi>Sums</hi> lent on the Land are great, They are difficult to be borrow'd; More Perſons having <hi>Small Sums</hi> than <hi>Great;</hi> and the <hi>Intereſt</hi> being greater than the <hi>

                     </gap>ent</hi> of the Land, and ſo being not paid, the <hi>Sum</hi> is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed. And becauſe it muſt be repaid together, The Borrowers are put under ſuch Difficulty in paying it, that before they can get it, they are often forecloſed of their Equity of Redemption, and many times Loſe a Fourth part of the Value of their Eſtates. And if they get it, they are very great Loſers by the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of the Money lying dead while they make up the <hi>Whole Sum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Conveniency to the Lenders, that Take the Bills of Credit, <hi>Are,</hi>
                  </hi> That tho' the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt</hi> be ſmall, yet their <hi>Security</hi> is on the Land, And the Money at demand; Which may be a greater Conveniency to them, when an Opportunity is offer'd, either in Purchaſing Goods or Land, than if they had a greater <hi>Intereſt</hi> on the ſame Land, and their Money not at command.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will be the Support of the Nobility and Gentry of England:</hi> By Lowering the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Money,</hi> and Raiſing the Value of their Eſtates; For in all Countries the Price of Land is govern'd by the Rate of the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of Money. When Money in <hi>England</hi> was at 8 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Land generally ſold for Fifteen or Sixteen Years Purchaſe: when it was reduc'd to 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Land was rais'd to Twenty Years Purchaſe; and after, Plenty of Money reducing <hi>Intereſt</hi> on <hi>Real Securities</hi> to 5 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Land ſold for Twenty four or Twenty five Years Purchaſe. And when the <hi>Land-Bank</hi> ſhall lend Money at 3 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> 10 <hi>
                     <abbr>s.</abbr> per Cent.</hi> Intereſt muſt be reduc'd to the ſame Rate; And Land, by the ſame Rule, muſt riſe to Thirty one and Thirty two Years Purchaſe. Beſides the other Advantages by this Settlement, which will be. By <hi>The Quick</hi> and <hi>Eaſie Borrowing of Money,</hi> and <hi>Buying</hi> and <hi>Selling Land,</hi> which will add to the Value of Land, and make it <hi>better than Ready Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> and may in time raiſe it to Forty Years Purchaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It will be a Publick Good to the Whole Nation:</hi> For the Land of <hi>England</hi> is the Fund and Riches of the Nation, by which the Government is ſupported, and the Nation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended; and whatſoever raiſeth the Value of Land, encreaſeth the Riches and Strength of the Nation.</p>
               <p>It's expected that the Settlement will be in a few Days ſealed; therefore thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that have occaſion to borrow Money of the <hi>Bank,</hi> or ſell their Eſtates, may Enter at the Office the Value of their Eſtates, and the Sum of Money they would borrow, and the Price they will ſell their Eſtates at; for it's intended to prevent all Exceptions, that the Securities ſhall be proceeded on, and all Matters diſpatched in Order, as they ſhall ſtand Enter'd in the Office.</p>
